Source code release of the Dirty Dozen team and online coach
------------------------------------------------------------
developed by the ORCA (Osnabrück RoboCup Agents) project
(also known as the Osna BallByters)


Acknowledgments:

Our player agents are based on the public parts of the source-code of the CMU-99 team.
CMUnited-99 source code is copyright from Peter Stone, Patrick Riley and Manuela Veloso
and can be downloaded from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pstone/RoboCup/CMUnited99-sim.html.
CMU's README is now named README_CMU and will give you a good overview about the
architecture.
For our additions and SFL-architecture please refer to docu.ps.gz




Compiling:

Some effort was put into creating an elegant Makefile. Simply typing "make" in the
orca-directory should compile the code on several platforms.
To compile the logfile-analyzer tool and the online coach, type "make" in the
orca/coach directory.




Running the team:

There are several startscripts which comment on the parameters for the players.
Note that there have to exist several files in the orca-directory:
server.conf, player.conf, client.conf
formation.conf
pppoints
orca.conf (this one is identical to orcaconf/basic_w_all_communication.conf)
You can copy any of the .conf-files in orcaconf to orca.conf
Adding -sfls to the commandline will make the agent run using SFLS (which is
a prerequisite for being compatible to online coach messages)



Running the coach and logfile analyzer:

Typing "./readLog" in the orca/coach directory will print a help text for using the
logfile analyzer tool.
To use the online coach, cd to orca/coach/online :
./onlinecoach -t TEAMNAME -h HOSTNAME -p PORT [optional: -v for verbose]
The online coach can only connect properly to the server if at least one of its players
are already connected to the server.



Mysterious files:

form_view.r is a REBOL-script used to visualize the formation.conf
